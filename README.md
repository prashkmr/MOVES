**Explanation:**

1. **Inline Link:** The first link, "npm package manager: [https://docs.npmjs.com/](https://docs.npmjs.com/)", is an inline link. The text displayed is "npm package manager" and the URL is included within parentheses.
2. **Reference Link:** The second link, "Project Wiki: wiki "Project Documentation"", is a reference link. We define the reference at the beginning using `[wiki]: URL "Project Documentation"`. Then, throughout the document, we use `[wiki]` to create the link with the desired text "Project Wiki".

This example demonstrates both methods and how they can be used together in your GitHub README.
